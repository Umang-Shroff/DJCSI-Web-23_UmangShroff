DJCSI interviews Front-End Web Development Task.

Install both HTML and CSS files in the same folder to make sure the site functions properly.

I have made this web page as a part of the basic task provided for DJCSI Interviews 2023. Due to time constraints and the complexity of the code I have failed to make the web page responsive ( 1225 x 665 size for optimal display ).

For CSI members reading through this:

THe images provided as part of the Assets in the task are not included because I have used hyperlinks to the images, and as a result only the HTML file and the CSS file are in the repository.
